We have a string and we need to find the first 4 characters
within the string that are not repeated. 
The way I see this happening is with two loops pulling in the
relevant characters and then comparing them to each other. Moving
up the string one character at a time.

// Test cases 
const testCase1 = 'bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz'
// first marker after character 5

const testCase2 = 'nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg'
// first marker after character 10
